# AIS geometry and axial current

### Requirements

In addition to standard scientific packages (scipy, matplotlib), this code requires:
* Seaborn
* [Brian 2](http://briansimulator.org)

Electrophysiological data from recorded in retina ganglion cells
(DOI: ) must be
[downloaded]() into the folder
`shared/resistive_coupling/hu-bean-2018`.

## The axial current at spike initiation

* `fig1.py`: 

## The threshold axial current

In this part, we show ...

## Adaptation of the axial current
